This project is a compact RGB macro pad built around the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040.
It uses diode-isolated push buttons for reliable key detection and SK6812 Mini addressable RGB LEDs for per-key lighting effects.

The design focuses on:

1.Programmable Multi-Button Input Panel
  Custom key mapping for 4–7 buttons, acting as a USB HID keyboard.

2.Multi-Layer Operation
  Supports multiple modes/layers with independent key functions and instant switching.

3.KMK + CircuitPython Firmware
  Easy to modify, beginner-friendly, and ideal for rapid prototyping.

4.Reliable Input Handling
  Software debouncing and stable button scanning for error-free operation.

5.Optional Rotary Encoder Support
  Layer-dependent encoder actions for volume, navigation, or fine control.

6.Expandable & PCB-Friendly Design
  Designed for custom PCBs with scope for future upgrades and features.
